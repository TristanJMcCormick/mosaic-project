Built a basic API-integrated react/redux/thunk project for easy extension as I interview for jobs.

This was scaffolded by [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

To run the app:

- get a (free, easy) api key from [NewsAPI](https://newsapi.org).
- Clone the repo and run `npm install` in the root
- Create a `.env` file with `REACT_APP_NEWS_API_KEY=<YOUR_API_KEY>`
- Run `npm start`
- Don't judge me too much for something I built in 90 minutes

Visit localhost:3000 to see the app.
